# phasematching_calc

Contains objects, methods, and functions that are designed for use in calculating phasematching effects in non-linear spectroscopy.

The current repository is limited to four-wave mixing spectroscopy (FWM) functions and methods, and the samples are assumed isotropic (or approximately isotropic).   Functions include calculation of phasematching factors to FWM intensities, solves for angles and/or frequencies to achieve phasematching, and several auxiliary functions to help in analyzing low-order FWM phenomena.

To install:   git clone or copy the folder into an empty directory then ``pip install .`` at the command prompt while in the main folder.
